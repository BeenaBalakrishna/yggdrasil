                         language are dependent on (e.g. Matlab models require Python).                                    
executable_type          'compiler' or 'interpreter' to indicate the type of the executable for the                    str 
                         language. [AUTOMATED]                                                                             
external_libraries       Information on external libraries required for running models in the target                   dict
                         language using yggdrasil.

                         language (e.g. if statements, for loops, while loops).                                            
interface_dependencies   List of names of libraries that are required to use the interface on the current              list
                         platform. This dosn't include libraries required by specific communication types                  
                         which are described by supported_comm_options.                                                    
interface_directories    Directories containing code in the interface library for the target language.                 list
interface_library        Name of the library containing the yggdrasil interface for the target language.    X          list
internal_libraries       Information on internal libraries required for running models in the target                   dict
                         language using yggdrasil.                                                                         
language                 Primary name for the programming language that this compiler should be used for.   X          str 
language_aliases         Additional/alternative names that the language may be known by.                               list
language_ext             Extensions for programs written in the target language.                            X          list
supported_comm_options   Options for the supported comms like the platforms they are available on and the   X          dict
                         external libraries required to use them.                                                          
supported_comms          Name of comms supported in the target language.                                    X          list
type_map                 Mapping of |yggdrasil| extended JSON types to datatypes in the target              X          dict
                         programming language.                                                                             
version_flags            Flags that should be called with the language executable to determine the                     list
                         version of the compiler/interpreter. Defaults to ['--version'].
