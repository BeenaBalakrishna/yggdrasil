args             array     X          Argument(s) for running the model on the command line. This should be a complete
                                      command including the necessary executable and command line arguments to that   
                                      executable.                                                                     
client_of        array                The names of ne or more servers that this model is a client of. Defaults to     
                                      empty list.                                                                     
driver           string               [DEPRECATED] Name of driver class that should be used.                          
inputs           array                Model inputs described as comm objects.                                         
is_server        boolean              If True, the model is assumed to be a server and an instance of                 
                                      :class:`yggdrasil.drivers.ServerDriver` is started. Defaults to False.          
language         string    X          The programming language that the model is written in. (Options described       
                                      :ref:`here <schema_table_model_subtype_rst>`)                                   
name             string    X          Name used for component in log messages.                                        
outputs          array                Model outputs described as comm objects.                                        
overwrite        boolean              If True, any existing model products (compilation products, wrapper scripts,    
                                      etc.) are removed prior to the run. If False, the products are not removed.     
                                      Defaults to True. Setting this to False can improve the performance,            
                                      particularly for models that take a long time to compile, but this should only  
                                      be done once the model has been fully debugged to ensure that each run is tested
                                      on a clean copy of the model. The value of this keyword also determines whether 
                                      or not products are removed after a run.                                        
preserve_cache   boolean              If True model products will be kept following the run, otherwise all products   
                                      will be cleaned up. Defaults to False. This keyword is superceeded by overwrite.
products         array                Paths to files created by the model that should be cleaned up when the model    
                                      exits. Entries can be absolute paths or paths relative to the working directory.
                                      Defaults to [].                                                                 
strace_flags     array                Flags to pass to strace (or dtrace). Defaults to [].                            
valgrind_flags   array                Flags to pass to valgrind. Defaults to [].                                      
with_strace      boolean              If True, the command is run with strace (on Linux) or dtrace (on MacOS).        
                                      Defaults to False.                                                              
with_valgrind    boolean              If True, the command is run with valgrind. Defaults to False.                   
working_dir      string    X          Working directory. If not provided, the current working directory is used.
