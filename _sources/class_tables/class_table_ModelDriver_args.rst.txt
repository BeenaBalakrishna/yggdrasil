args             Argument(s) for running the model on the command line. This should be a complete   X          str or list
                 command including the necessary executable and command line arguments to that                            
                 executable.                                                                                              
client_of        The names of ne or more servers that this model is a client of. Defaults to                   str, list  
                 empty list.                                                                                              
is_server        If True, the model is assumed to be a server and an instance of                               bool       
                 :class:`yggdrasil.drivers.ServerDriver` is started. Defaults to False.                                   
model_index      Index of model in list of models being run. Defaults to 0.                                    int        
name             Driver name.                                                                       X          str        
overwrite        If True, any existing model products (compilation products, wrapper scripts,                  bool       
                 etc.) are removed prior to the run. If False, the products are not removed.                              
                 Defaults to True. Setting this to False can improve the performance,                                     
                 particularly for models that take a long time to compile, but this should only                           
                 be done once the model has been fully debugged to ensure that each run is tested                         
                 on a clean copy of the model. The value of this keyword also determines whether                          
                 or not products are removed after a run.                                                                 
preserve_cache   If True model products will be kept following the run, otherwise all products                 bool       
                 will be cleaned up. Defaults to False. This keyword is superceeded by overwrite.                         
products         Paths to files created by the model that should be cleaned up when the model                  list       
                 exits. Entries can be absolute paths or paths relative to the working directory.                         
                 Defaults to [].                                                                                          
strace_flags     Flags to pass to strace (or dtrace). Defaults to [].                                          list       
valgrind_flags   Flags to pass to valgrind. Defaults to [].                                                    list       
with_strace      If True, the command is run with strace (on Linux) or dtrace (on MacOS).                      bool       
                 Defaults to False.                                                                                       
with_valgrind    If True, the command is run with valgrind. Defaults to False.                                 bool
