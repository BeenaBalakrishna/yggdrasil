combine_with_linker      If True, the compiler and linker flags can be combined and passed to the                      bool 
                         compiler executable to perform both operations in succession. If False, the                        
                         compilation and linking steps must be performed separately. If None, this is                       
                         determined by checking if the compiler and linker names match.                                     
compile_only_flag        Flag that should prepended to compiler/linker combination tool arguments to                   str  
                         indicate that only compilation should be performed.                                                
default_archiver         Name of archiver that should be used to create a static library after compiling               str  
                         with this compiler. If not set, it is assumed that this compiler is also a                         
                         linker.                                                                                            
default_archiver_flags   Flags that should be used with the archiver if no other flags are provided.                   list 
default_linker           Name of linker that should be used after compiling with this compiler. If not                 str  
                         set, it is assumed that this compiler is also a linker.                                            
default_linker_flags     Flags that should be used with the linker if no other flags are provided.                     list 
is_linker                If True, the tool also serves as a linker and a separate linker class will be                 bool 
                         automatically generating from the linker_attributes dictionary. This will be set                   
                         to True if no_separate_linking is True.                                                            
linker_attributes        Attributes that should be added to the linker class created for this tool if                  dict 
                         is_linker is True.                                                                                 
linker_base_classes      Base classes that should be used to create the default linker from the compiler               tuple
                         tool. If None, (LinkerBase, ) is used if no_separate_linking is False and                          
                         (DummyLinkerBase, ) is used if no_separate_linking is True.                                        
linker_switch            Flag to indicate beginning of flags that should be passed to the linker from a                str  
                         call to a compiler/linker combination tools (e.g. /link on Windows).                               
no_separate_linking      If True, the tool severs as linker but cannot be called for just compilation or               bool 
                         linking alone.                                                                                     
object_ext               Extension that should be used for object files.                                               str
