abstract = {CellML is an XML-based exchange format developed by the University of Auckland in collaboration with Physiome Sciences, Inc. CellML 1.1 has a component-based architecture allowing a modeller to build complex systems of models that expand and reuse previously published models. CellML Metadata is a format for encoding contextual information for a model. CellML 1.1 can be used in conjunction with CellML Metadata to provide a complete description of the structure and underlying mathematics of biological models. A repository of over 200 electrophysiological, mechanical, signal transduction, and metabolic pathway models is available at www.cellml.org.},

abstract = {Analyzing biological data (e.g., annotating genomes, assembling NGS data...) may involve very complex and inter-linked steps where several tools are combined together. Scientific workflow systems have reached a level of maturity that makes them able to support the design and execution of such in-silico experiments, and thus making them increasingly popular in the bioinformatics community. However, in some emerging application domains such as system biology, developmental biology or ecology, the need for data analysis is combined with the need to model complex multi-scale biological systems, possibly involving multiple simulation steps. This requires the scientific work-flow to deal with retro-action to understand and predict the relationships between structure and function of these complex systems. OpenAlea (openalea.gforge.inria.fr) is the only scientific workflow system able to uniformly address the problem, which made it successful in the scientific community. One of its main originality is to introduce higher-order dataflows as a means to uniformly combine classical data analysis with modeling and simulation. In this demonstration paper, we provide for the first time the description of the OpenAlea system involving an original combination of features. We illustrate the demonstration on a high-throughput workflow in phenotyping, phenomics, and environmental control designed to study the interplay between plant architecture and climatic change.},

abstract = {Latest (patched) version: HTML: http://yaml.org/spec/1.2/spec.html PDF: http://yaml.org/spec/1.2/spec.pdf PS: http://yaml.org/spec/1.2/spec.ps Errata: http://yaml.org/spec/1.2/errata.html Previous (original) version: http://yaml.org/spec/1. Status of this Document This document reflects the third version of YAML data serialization language. The content of the specification was arrived at by consensus of its authors and through user feedback on the yaml-core mailing list. We encourage implementers to please update their software with support for this version. The primary objective of this revision is to bring YAML into compliance with JSON as an official subset. YAML 1.2 is compatible with 1.1 for most practical applications-this is a minor revision. An expected source of incompatibility with prior versions of YAML, especially the syck implementation, is the change in implicit typing rules. We have removed unique implicit typing rules and have updated these rules to align them with JSON's productions. In this version of YAML, boolean values may be serialized as "true" or "false"; the empty scalar as "null". Unquoted numeric values are a superset of JSON's numeric production. Other changes in the specification were the removal of the Unicode line breaks and production bug fixes. We also define 3 built-in implicit typing rule sets: untyped, strict JSON, and a more flexible YAML rule set that extends JSON typing. The difference between late 1.0 drafts which syck 0.55 implements and the 1.1 revision of this specification is much more extensive. We fixed usability issues with the tagging syntax. In particular, the single exclamation was redefined for private types and a simple prefixing mechanism was introduced. This revision also fixed many production edge cases and introduced a type repository. Therefore, there are several incompatibilities between syck and this revision as well. The list of known errors in this specification is available at http://yaml.org/spec/1.2/errata.html. Please report errors in this document to the yaml-core mailing list. This revision contains fixes for all errors known as of 2009-10-01. We wish to thank implementers who have tirelessly tracked earlier versions of this specification, and our fabulous user community whose feedback has both validated and clarified our direction. Abstract YAML™ (rhymes with "camel") is a human-friendly, cross language, Unicode based data serialization language designed around the common native data types of agile programming languages. It is broadly useful for programming needs ranging from configuration files to Internet messaging to object persistence to data auditing. Together with the Unicode standard for characters, this specification provides all the information necessary to understand YAML Version 1.2 and to create programs that process YAML information.

@article{Boudon2012,
abstract = {The study of plant development requires increasingly powerful modeling tools to help understand and simulate the growth and functioning of plants. In the last decade, the formalism of L-systems has emerged as a major paradigm for modeling plant development. Previous implementations of this formalism were made based on static languages, i.e., languages that require explicit definition of variable types before using them. These languages are often efficient but involve quite a lot of syntactic overhead, thus restricting the flexibility of use for modelers. In this work, we present an adaptation of L-systems to the Python language, a popular and powerful open-license dynamic language. We show that the use of dynamic language properties makes it possible to enhance the development of plant growth models: (i) by keeping a simple syntax while allowing for high-level programming constructs, (ii) by making code execution easy and avoiding compilation overhead, (iii) by allowing a high-level of model reusability and the building of complex modular models, and (iv) by providing powerful solutions to integrate MTG data-structures (that are a common way to represent plants at several scales) into L-systems and thus enabling to use a wide spectrum of computer tools based on MTGs developed for plant architecture. We then illustrate the use of L-Py in real applications to build complex models or to teach plant modeling in the classroom.},

abstract = {MPI (Message Passing Interface) is a specification for a standard library for message passing that was defined by the MPI Forum, a broadly based group of parallel computer vendors, library writers, and applications specialists. Multiple implementations of MPI have been developed. In this paper, we describe MPICH, unique among existing implementations in its design goal of combining portability with high performance. We document its portability and performance and describe the architecture by which these features are simultaneously achieved. We also discuss the set of tools that accompany the free distribution of MPICH, which constitute the beginnings of a portable parallel programming environment. A project of this scope inevitably imparts lessons about parallel computing, the specification being followed, the current hardware and software environment for parallel computing, and project management; we describe those we have learned. Finally, we discuss future developments for MPICH, including those necessary to accommodate extensions to the MPI Standard now being contemplated by the MPI Forum.},

The result is a myriad of incompatible MPI implementations, all of which require separate installation, and the combination of which present significant logistical challenges for end users. Building upon prior research, and influenced by experience gained from the code bases of the LAM/MPI, LA-MPI, and FT-MPI projects, Open MPI is an all-new, production-quality MPI-2 implementation that is fundamentally centered around component concepts. Open MPI provides a unique combination of novel features previously unavailable in an open-source, production-quality implementation of MPI. Its component architecture provides both a stable platform for third-party research as well as enabling the run-time composition of independent software add-ons.
